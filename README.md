# Next Word Prediction Project

## Project Title: Predicting the Next Word in a Given Sentence

### Description
This project is an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) application designed to predict the next word in a given sequence of words. The model leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture and employs techniques like early stopping to enhance performance and prevent overfitting. The application is built using Streamlit, allowing for a user-friendly web interface.

### Features
- **Next Word Prediction**: Enter a sequence of words, and the model predicts the next word.
- **History Tracking**: Keep track of previous inputs and their corresponding predicted words.
- **Responsive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive experience.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for building the model and the application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for building and training the GRU model.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the web application.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Pickle**: Library for serializing and deserializing Python objects.

### Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
